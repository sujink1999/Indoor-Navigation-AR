# Indoor-Navigation-AR
This project uses augrmented reality to navigate 
Augmented reality wayfinding serves as a digital guide to aid navigation.
This technology allows us to superimpose digital information into the
physical-world in realtime. Using a mobile device, people can navigate their way
around complex spaces such as theme parks, zoos, universities, hospitals,
airports, and shopping centres. A person can walk into a completely unfamiliar
environment with no information about the area, then using their own mobile
device, they can take an interactive tour or navigate to their intended destination.
The AR system is so precise it can guide users to a ride in a theme park or to
baggage claim at a busy airport. Using AR in this way increases the effectiveness
of navigation systems by displaying a variety of visual content such as directions,
length of the trip, possible hazards, alternative routes and any other points of
interest.
